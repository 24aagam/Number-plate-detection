# Number Plate Detection Using OpenCV
## ðŸ“– Overview
This project demonstrates a simple and effective approach to **number plate detection** using **OpenCV** and its pre-trained **Haarcascade Russian Plate Number** classifier. The application detects and localizes vehicle number plates in images or video streams, showcasing the potential of object detection for real-world applications.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Real-time number plate detection.
- Accurate plate localization using Haarcascade.
- Lightweight and efficient for deployment in basic applications.
